                <p>
                I am a frontend developer with a particular interest in making things simple and simplifying daily tasks. 
                I am interested in a career in technology because a career in IT will continuously expose me to new developments and concepts. 
                I try to keep up with security and best practices, and am always looking for new things to learn.
